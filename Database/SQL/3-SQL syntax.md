## What is SQL Syntax?

SQL syntax is a unique set of rules and guidelines to be followed while writing SQL statements. This tutorial gives you a quick start with SQL by listing all the basic SQL Syntax.

All the SQL statements start with any of the keywords like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, USE, SHOW and all the statements end with a semicolon (;).

## Case Sensitivity

The most important point to be noted here is that SQL is case insensitive, which means **SELECT** and **Select** have same meaning in SQL statements. Whereas, MySQL makes difference in table names. So, if you are working with MySQL, then you need to give table names as they exist in the database.



All the SQL statements require a **semicolon (;)** at the end of each statement. Semicolon is the standard way to separate different SQL statements which allows to include multiple SQL statements in a single line.
