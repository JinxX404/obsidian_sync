class is a blueprint for an object. When you instantiate an object, you use a class as the basis for how the object is built. In fact, trying to explain classes and objects is really a chicken-and-egg dilemma. It is difficult to describe a class without using the term object and vice versa. For example, a specific individual bike is an object. However, someone had to have created the blueprints (that is, the class) to build the bike. In OO software, unlike the
chicken-and-egg dilemma, we do know what comes firstâ€”the class. An object cannot be instantiated without a class. Thus, many of the concepts in this section are similar to those presented earlier in the chapter, especially when we talk about attributes and methods

A class can be thought of as a sort of higher-level data type. For example, just as you create an integer or a float:
    int x;
    float y;
you can also create an object by using a predefined class:
    myClassmy Object; 
In this example, the names themselves make it obvious that myClass is the class and myObject is the object.
