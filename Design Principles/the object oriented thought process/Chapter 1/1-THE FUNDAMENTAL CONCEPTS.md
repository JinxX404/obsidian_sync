Historically, object-oriented languages are defined by the following: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism (what I call “classical” OO). Thus, **if a language does not implement all of these, it is generally not considered completely object-oriented.** Along with these three terms, I always include composition in the mix; thus, my list of object-oriented concepts looks like this:
• Encapsulation 
• Inheritance 
• Polymorphism 
• Composition
