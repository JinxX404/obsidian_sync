* Design pattern is a way or a method sometimes people say that it is an industry standard approach used to solve common software problems. 
*  It is an approach that can be used to solve problem that occur a lot in the software.
* There exist several advantages to the design pattern. It can be reusable (easy to use), maintainable, and easy to understand as it is industry standard approach.

**Design patterns** are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.

You can’t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design. When a solution gets repeated over and over in various projects, someone eventually puts a name to it and describes the solution in detail. That’s basically how a pattern gets discovered.

Design patterns are a toolkit of **tried and tested solutions** to common problems in software design.



## Classification of patterns

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of detail and scale of applicability to the entire system being designed. I like the analogy to road construction: you can make an intersection safer by either installing some traffic lights or building an entire multi-level interchange with underground passages for pedestrians.

The most basic and low-level patterns are often called _idioms_. They usually apply only to a single programming language.

The most universal and high-level patterns are _architectural patterns_. Developers can implement these patterns in virtually any language. Unlike other patterns, they can be used to design the architecture of an entire application.

three main groups of patterns:

- **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Questions asked to ensure that we understood each pattern

- What problem does this pattern solve?
- What category does it belong to?
- How does it work?
- What are the key components?
- When should I use it?
- What are the pros and cons?
- How does it compare to similar patterns?
- How can I recognize this pattern in existing code?
- What are common pitfalls?
- Can I implement it myself?
- What’s a real-world example?
- What happens if I don’t use it where needed?
- How does it support SOLID principles?
