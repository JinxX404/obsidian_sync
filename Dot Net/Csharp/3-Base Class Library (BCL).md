The Base Class Library (BCL) is a sub-part of the framework that provides library support to common language runtime. And it is primarily developed by using C# language. And it includes the System namespace and core types of the .NET framework. The Base Class Library is **also known as .Net Framework Class Library (FCL)**

The Base Class Library (BCL) has a rich collection of library features and functions. And the main specialty of this library is that it can be consumed by any .NET language.  It provides a set of reusable types, collections, classes, interfaces, and other components that are commonly used in .NET applications.
