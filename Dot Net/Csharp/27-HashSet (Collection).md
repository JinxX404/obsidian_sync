A **HashSet<T>** is an unordered collection of the **unique elements**. It comes under _**System.Collections.Generic**_ namespace. It is used in a situation where we want to prevent duplicates from being inserted in the collection. As far as performance is concerned, it is better in comparison to the list.

من ضمن الgeneric يعني type safe

**Characteristics of HashSet Class:**

- The HashSet<**T**> class provides high-performance set operations. A set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements, and whose elements are in no particular order.
- The capacity of a HashSet<**T**> object is the number of elements that the object can hold.
- A HashSet<**T**> object’s capacity automatically increases as elements are added to the object.
- A HashSet<**T**> collection is not sorted and cannot contain duplicate elements.
- HashSet<**T**> provides many mathematical set operations, such as set addition (unions) and set subtraction.
