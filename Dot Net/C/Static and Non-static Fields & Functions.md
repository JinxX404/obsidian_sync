In C#, the concepts of static and non-static members (methods and fields) are quite similar to Java. Here's a brief overview of how static and non-static members work in C#:

1. **Static Methods and Fields**:
    - Static methods are associated with the class itself, not with instances of the class. You can call them using the class name, and you don't need to create an instance of the class to invoke them, just like in Java.
    - Static fields are also associated with the class and are shared among all instances of the class. They can be accessed using the class name.

Example of calling static members in C#:

```C#
public class MyClass
{
    // Static field
    public static int staticField = 42;

    // Static method
    public static void StaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a static method.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Accessing static field
        int fieldValue = MyClass.staticField;

        // Calling static method
        MyClass.StaticMethod();
    }
}
```

1. **Non-Static (Instance) Methods and Fields**:
    - Non-static methods and fields are associated with instances (objects) of the class, just like in Java. You need to create an object of the class to access them.

Example of calling non-static members in C#:

```C#
public class MyClass
{
    // Non-static field
    public int nonStaticField = 0;

    // Non-static method
    public void NonStaticMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("This is a non-static method.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an object of MyClass
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();

        // Accessing non-static field
        int fieldValue = obj.nonStaticField;

        // Calling non-static method
        obj.NonStaticMethod();
    }
}
```

So, in C#, the concepts are quite similar to Java regarding static and non-static members. Non-static methods and fields in C# are associated with instances and require objects to access, just like in Java.

methods and fields can be classified as either static or non-static (also called instance). The difference between these two types lies in how they are associated with the class and objects created from that class:

1. **Static Methods and Fields**:
    - Static methods belong to the class itself, not to any particular instance (object) of the class. They can be called using the class name, and you don't need to create an instance of the class to invoke them. For example, `ClassName.staticMethod()`.
    - Static fields are also associated with the class and are shared among all instances of the class. They can be accessed using the class name as well, like `ClassName.staticField`.
2. **Non-Static (Instance) Methods and Fields**:
    - Non-static methods and fields are associated with instances (objects) of the class. You need to create an object of the class to access them. For example, `ClassName object = new ClassName();` to create an instance, and then `object.nonStaticMethod()` to call a non-static method, or `object.nonStaticField` to access a non-static field.

Now, let's address your question about why you need to create an object from a class to access non-static methods:

When you have a non-static method, it typically operates on the data that belongs to a specific instance of the class. Since non-static methods are associated with instances, they don't exist until you create an object from the class. Therefore, you need an object to invoke a non-static method because the method may need to work with the specific data and state of that object.

In other words, non-static methods often access and manipulate the instance (object) variables, which are unique to each instance. That's why you need an object to call a non-static method because the method's behavior is specific to the instance it's called on.

Here's a simple example to illustrate this concept:

```Java
public class MyClass {
    // Non-static field
    private int value;

    // Constructor to initialize the value
    public MyClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    // Non-static method that uses the instance variable
    public void printValue() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of MyClass
        MyClass obj = new MyClass(42);

        // Call the non-static method using the object
        obj.printValue();
    }
}
```

In this example, `printValue()` is a non-static method that accesses the `value` instance variable. You can only call `printValue()` by creating an object (`obj`) because it operates on the specific `value` associated with that instance.

In summary, non-static methods are tied to the state of individual instances of a class, so you need to create objects to use them and access the instance-specific data.
