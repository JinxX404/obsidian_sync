[Python Match-Case Statement - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-match-case-statement/)

The match-case statement, also known as pattern matching, is a feature introduced in Python 3.10. It provides a concise and expressive way to perform pattern matching on data structures, such as tuples, lists, and classes. It allows you to match the value of an expression against a series of patterns and execute the corresponding block of code for the matched pattern.
